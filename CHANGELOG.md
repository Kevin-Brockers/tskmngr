## [Unreleased]

### Added

- [#1](https://github.com/Kevin-Brockers/tskmngr/pull/1) - `AGENTS.md` with project overview, working etiquette, tech stack, task
  storage format and working conventions for coding agents
- [#1](https://github.com/Kevin-Brockers/tskmngr/pull/1) - prek pre-commit hooks: file hygiene checks, ruff lint/format and a
  guard against committing to `main` and `dev`
- [#1](https://github.com/Kevin-Brockers/tskmngr/pull/1) - Claude Code hook that shows the staged diff and asks for approval
  before every `git commit`
- [#1](https://github.com/Kevin-Brockers/tskmngr/pull/1) - `CHANGELOG.md` and the changelog policy in `AGENTS.md`
- [#1](https://github.com/Kevin-Brockers/tskmngr/pull/1) - Branching policy: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/` and `chore/` branches
  with pull requests against `dev`; `dev` → `main` only for releases
- [#2](https://github.com/Kevin-Brockers/tskmngr/pull/2) - `ROADMAP.md` with milestones and traceable steps, and the roadmap
  policy in `AGENTS.md`
- #TBD - Roadmap milestones M1 to M5: core, CLI, TUI, external edits and
  configuration, subtasks and recurring tasks, with the planned modules in the
  `AGENTS.md` project layout
- [7982e5c](https://github.com/Kevin-Brockers/tskmngr/commit/7982e5c9b62c955e9fe1f08a551be97f5dabf555) - Initial repository with `README.md` and MIT license

### Changed

- #TBD - Approved dependency baseline: `ruamel.yaml` replaces `pyyaml` so
  saving a task keeps frontmatter comments and formatting, and `pytest-asyncio`
  is added for Textual's async UI tests
- #TBD - Task storage format in `AGENTS.md`: the filename is the task's ID (no
  `id` key in the frontmatter), deleted tasks move to `.trash/`, and a value of
  the wrong type makes a file malformed
